Assumption:
    Opfor:
        50 men
        military grade weapons
        1 mortar team
        1 sniper team
        3 riflemen squads
        1 support squad (medical, intelligence, commandsers, etc)
        little previous AO knowledge
        highly specialized in role
        negative rapport with local population
    Friendly:
        6 bubbas
        prepper grade weapons
        riflemen loadouts
        very good previous AO knowledge
        less specialized knowledge, decently crosstrained 
        possitive rapport with local population
    Local:
        locals are irritated
        public services and utilities are failing
        north GA, demographics are mostly older and/or farming families
        high gun owndership rates
        high self reliance skills

1) First thing team will do is take inventory of gear and resources. Immediately make contact with friendly locals.
Topographic maps and Google street view show a small hill on the south west side of my side of the bridge.
Hill has a relatively good view of bridge and both sides of the river. Google street view shows a two story house on bridge.
2) Hopefully the two story house is either unoccupied or a friendly local lives there. Either way, setup well concealed LP/OP on hill.
Google says Opfor side of the river has most of the gas stations, grocery stores, banks, hospitals, etc. 
This is fantastic because Opfor will likely not completely restrict their side of the river.
Google also says that most of the bars, restraurants, downtown, entertainment, etc. is on my side of the river. 
3) Recruit locals to be eyes and ears on Opfor side of the river. The French resistance used older ladies and children to listen and observe
troops in WWII. Considering Opfor is based on the side of the river with places like the grocery store, locals can provide intelligence by 
just performing daily activies. 
4) Recruit eyes and ears for the downtown watering holes on my side of the river.
5) Use above intelligence resources to profile Opfor. I want to know where their weapons are stored. Where is the mortar placement. 
which of them are officers. Who is their medical personal. Do they have strong communication with a larger force?
6) Raid their explosives. 
7) Target squad leaders and medics in town. Brutally unalive them
This will piss off platoon leader. Patrols will increase. 
8) Plant explosives in downtown area. 
Google maps shows that the downtown area is a pretty confusing collection of roads and allies.
9) 3 men target the mortar team, neutralize mortar, fall back over river. Cause enough mayhem on retreat to bait at least 2 rifle squads back downtown
10) Downtown has a lot of elevated buildings with lots of windows, as opfor squads chace 3 man team back downtown, we will drag them through the 
streets catching them with explosives and elevated positions.

The result should be most of the squad leaders will be dead. Mortar team will be neutralized. Platoon will be under half capacity. Hopefully 
they can't get backup easily. Part of the intelligence in step 3 was determining communications capability. This plan changes a good bit if 
eleminating this platoon results in another platoon taking its place.

When analyzing data on device vulnerabilities across vendors of varying sizes without knowing the exact number of devices each vendor produces, several statistical approaches can be utilized to normalize and compare data effectively. Here are some methods to consider:

## 1. Vulnerability Rate Estimation
- Categorize vendors into size buckets based on an educated guess about their device production range.
- Calculate the vulnerability rate (number of vulnerabilities reported per device category) to normalize data by vendor size category.

## 2. Standardization (Z-Score Normalization)
- Standardize the number of vulnerabilities reported for each vendor by subtracting the dataset mean and dividing by the standard deviation.
- This method does not require knowing the number of devices but allows for comparing vendors relative to the overall distribution.

## 3. Min-Max Scaling
- Apply Min-Max Scaling to rescale the number of vulnerabilities to a fixed range (usually 0 to 1).
- This method scales the vulnerability counts directly and enhances data interpretability.

## 4. Weighted Scoring System
- Create a weighted scoring system using additional data attributes (e.g., severity, impact scores) and calculate a composite score for each vendor.
- This approach normalizes data by focusing on qualitative aspects rather than just the quantity of vulnerabilities.

## 5. Quantile Normalization
- Use quantile normalization to adjust the distribution of vulnerabilities reported for each vendor to match a reference distribution or a standard distribution.
- Useful when the data across vendors are skewed or have outliers.

## 6. Statistical Modeling
- Consider statistical modeling techniques like Poisson regression or negative binomial regression suitable for count data.
- These models can include proxies of vendor size as covariates to understand the factors influencing the number of vulnerabilities.

Each method has its considerations, based on the data nature, the assumptions of statistical techniques, and analysis goals. It might also be beneficial to derive insights from multiple methods for a comprehensive view.
